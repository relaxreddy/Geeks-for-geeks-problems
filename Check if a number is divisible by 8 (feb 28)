question 
Given a string representation of a decimal number s, check whether it is divisible by 8.

Example 1:

Input:
s = "16"
Output:
1
Explanation:
The given number is divisible by 8,
so the driver code prints 1 as the output.
Example 2:

Input:
s = "54141111648421214584416464555"
Output:
-1
Explanation:
Given Number is not divisible by 8, 
so the driver code prints -1 as the output.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything.Your task is to complete the function DivisibleByEight() which takes a string s as the input and returns 1 if the number is divisible by 8, else it returns -1.

Expected Time Complexity: O(1).
Expected Auxillary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 <= Number represented by the string s < 10^6     need c++code with class Solution 



c++ code 
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int DivisibleByEight(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        
        
        if (n < 3) {
            int num = stoi(s);
            if (num % 8 == 0)
                return 1;
            else
                return -1;
        }
        
        
        int num = stoi(s.substr(n - 3));
        if (num % 8 == 0)
            return 1;
        else
            return -1;
    }
};
