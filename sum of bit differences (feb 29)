question 
Given an array integers arr[], containing n elements, find the sum of bit differences between all pairs of element in the array. Bit difference of a pair (x, y) is the count of different bits at the same positions in binary representations of x and y.
For example, bit difference for 2 and 7 is 2. Binary representation of 2 is 010 and 7 is 111 respectively and the first and last bits differ between the two numbers.

Note: (x, y) and (y, x) are considered two separate pairs.

Example 1:

Input: 
n = 2
arr[] = {1, 2}
Output: 4
Explanation: All possible pairs of an array are (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2).
Sum of bit differences = 0 + 2 + 2 + 0
                       = 4
Example 2:

Input:
n = 3 
arr[] = {1, 3, 5}
Output: 8
Explanation: 
All possible pairs of an array are (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3) (3, 5),(5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5).
Sum of bit differences = 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 0 
                       = 8
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function sumBitDifferences() which takes the array arr[] and n as inputs and return an integer that represents the sum of the bit differences between all possible pairs of elements in the array.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 105
1 <= arr[i] <= 105



python3 code
class Solution:
    def sumBitDifferences(self, arr, n):
        ans = 0
        
        # Iterate through all the bits
        for i in range(32):
            # Count the number of elements with i'th bit set
            count = 0
            for num in arr:
                if num & (1 << i):
                    count += 1
            
            # Add the bit difference contribution for this bit position
            ans += count * (n - count) * 2
        
        return ans

# Test cases
s = Solution()
arr1 = [1, 2]
arr2 = [1, 3, 5]
print("Output 1:", s.sumBitDifferences(arr1, len(arr1)))  # Output: 4
print("Output 2:", s.sumBitDifferences(arr2, len(arr2)))  # Output: 8
